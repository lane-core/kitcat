# Kitcat: A research kit for univalent mathematics and computability theory

This library written in [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda), currently in an early stage of development, is directed towards the study of mathematics and theories of computation from the [univalent point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univalent_foundations). Specifically, we focus on developing the methods of *graphical* theories of computation within type theory, such as:
* [Interaction Nets](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/interaction_nets.html)
* [String Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08768)
* More generally, the sorts of mathematical structures defined in the rich theory underpinning [Braided](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/braided+monoidal+category) and [Symmetric Monoidal Categories](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/symmetric+monoidal+category)

## Our Approach

While there are many libraries hosting excellent contributions from bright minds exploring this exciting field, to name just three (of many): [agda-unimath](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/), [TypeTopology](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/TypeTopology/), and [1lab](https://1lab.dev/), we intend to delineate alternative approaches to this subject to push forward the development of next generation type theories. Hence, Kitcat will proceed in an idiosyncratic, opinionated, and experimental fashion tailored to the aims of the research directions pursued here.

## Research Perspectives

A central aim of Kitcat is to survey and reevaluate results from the discipline of [Homotopy Type Theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+type+theory) from two perspectives: 
 1. **Reinterpretation:** We revisit early and foundational results through the lens of latest developments, exploring reformulations of various topics in univalent type theory with constructions like Iosef Petrakis's [Univalent typoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06651). 
 2. **Historical Survey:** We trace back to the moment when homotopy theory ideas inspired mathematicians like Vladimir Voevodsky to explore the applicability of topological methods to computation theory. We aim to explore this development in conjunction with Voevodsky's contemporaries who were investigating similar connections from the perspective of graph theory. 
 
## Goals

Our primary aim is to meaningfully relate results from the period "converging towards a *homotopical theory of computation*" ([Lafont, *Algebra and Geometry of Rewriting*](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/~lafont/pub/agr.pdf)). Through this approach, we hope to:

* Develop novel perspectives and methods
* Establish meaningful directions for 21st-century type theories, aiding and clarifying results in the latest research directions of this exciting field
* Formalize important research in the history of graphical computation theories, along with results from their predecessors in systems like Linear Logic
* Contribute to the ongoing evolution of mathematical foundations in computer science

We welcome contributions and discussions from researchers interested in these cutting-edge intersections of mathematics and computation.
